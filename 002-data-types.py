# Sequences: strings, lists, tuples, byte arrays
# Tuple: can't change
# Operations on the sequences

# Lists: mutable sequence (can have values of different types)
# Access one: list[0]
# Slice: list[:]
# Print twice list * 2

# Tuple: uses ()
# is read-only

# Dictionary: like a hash table
# keys must be of immutable data types
# no order of elements
